This project uses EPA AQI data in order to create 6 Bi-GRU models to generate a day's worth of AQI, based on the type of pollutant.  

CSV Files can be retrieved at https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Raw  
Pollutant data used in our model training are between 23' and 25'.  
The pollutant types are `Carbon Monoxide`, `Nitrogen Dioxide`, `Ozone`, `Sulfur Dioxide`, `PM2.5`, and `PM10`
